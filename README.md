A Minecraft modpack for THI's minecraft server, built with [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/).

Includes all the required mods and their dependencies. This also suggests some optional ones that you can choose to
install if you want - performance improvement mods that everyone ought to use, and a handful of quality-of-life
improvements to help you get your bearings and search the web for info less often.

## Usage (basic)

The easiest thing for most people is to [download and import the auto-updating instance](https://github.com/qtfelix/thi-modpack/releases/download/autoupdater-v1/THI-modpack.zip)
into [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/) or MultiMC. It uses [packwiz-installer](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer)
to automatically check for and install modpack updates for you every time you start the game.

Here's a little video guide:

If that's confusing or you'd rather use the vanilla launcher etc. then **that's ok!** You can ask for a premade zip of
the mods, though it won't autoupdate.

## Usage (advanced)

If you don't trust the auto-updater that was posted, you can quickly make one yourself by [following these instructions](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/).
Use `https://qtfelix.github.io/thi-modpack/v1/pack.toml` for the pack URL.
