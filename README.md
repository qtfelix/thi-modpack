A Minecraft modpack for THI's minecraft server, using [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/).

Includes all the required mods and their dependencies. This also has some optional ones that you can choose to install if you want - performance improvement mods that everyone ought to use, and a handful of quality-of-life improvements to help you look up the wiki less often and get your bearings after taking time off the game.

### Usage (basic)

Most people should use the auto-updating instance for the [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/)/MultiMC launcher. If that's confusing or you'd rather use the vanilla launcher etc. then **that's ok!** You can ask for a premade zip of the mods, though it won't autoupdate.

### Usage (advanced)

If you don't trust the auto-updater that was posted, you can quickly make one yourself
